I am **Yiming DU**, a PhD candidate at the **Chinese University of Hong Kong**.  
My research focuses on **AI memory systems**, **long-context reasoning**, and **multi-session dialogue**.  
I am particularly interested in designing memory-enhanced large language models (LLMs), spanning parametric, structured, and unstructured memory mechanisms.

You can learn more via my [CV](/cv/) or check out my recent [publications](/publications/).
