Hi, I am **Yiming (Elvin) DU**. I am a PhD candidate at the **Chinese University of Hong Kong**, pursuing my PhD in the Department of SEEM at CUHK under the supervision of <a href='https://www.se.cuhk.edu.hk/people/academic-staff/prof-wong-kam-fai/'>Professor Kam-Fai Wong</a>. I conduct my research at the <a href='https://www1.se.cuhk.edu.hk/~moelab/'>MoE Key Laboratory of High Confidence Software Technologies (MoE Lab)</a>, which is led by Professor Wong. I am currently a visiting scholar at <a href='https://edinburghnlp.inf.ed.ac.uk/'>EdinburghNLP</a>, working with <a href='https://knowledge-representation.org/j.z.pan/'>Jeff Z. Pan</a>.

My current research focuses on **Memory**, **Dialogue System** and **Data Selection**. I am particularly interested in memory reasoning, reinforcement learning in Agent Memory and applications in personal assistant.
